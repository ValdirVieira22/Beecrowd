#include <iostream>
 
using namespace std;
  
int main() {
    
    double x, y;
    double t;
    
    scanf("%lf""%lf", &x, &y);
    
    if(x == 1){
        
        x = 4.00;
        
    }
    else if( x == 2){
        
        x = 4.50;
    }
    else if(x == 3){
        
        x = 5.00;
    }
    else if(x == 4){
        
        x = 2.00;
    }
    else if(x == 5){
        
        x = 1.50;
    }
    
    t = x*y;
