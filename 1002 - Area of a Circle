//The formula to calculate the area of a circumference is defined as A = π . R2. Considering to this problem that π = 3.14159:

Calculate the area using the formula given in the problem description.

Input
The input contains a value of floating point (double precision), that is the variable R.

Output
Present the message "A=" followed by the value of the variable, as in the example bellow, with four places after the decimal point. Use all double precision variables.//



#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>

using namespace std;
 
int main() {
 
    double R;
    
    scanf("%lf", &R);
    
    printf("A=%.4lf\n", 3.14159*pow(R, 2.0));
    
    return 0;
}
