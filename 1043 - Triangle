//Read three point floating values (A, B and C) and verify if is possible to make a triangle with them. If it is possible, calculate the perimeter of the triangle and print the message:


Perimetro = XX.X


If it is not possible, calculate the area of the trapezium which basis A and B and C as height, and print the message:


Area = XX.X

Input
The input file has tree floating point numbers.

Output
Print the result with one digit after the decimal point.//
