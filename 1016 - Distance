Two cars (X and Y) leave in the same direction. The car X leaves with a constant speed of 60 km/h and the car Y leaves with a constant speed of 90 km / h.

In one hour (60 minutes) the car Y can get a distance of 30 kilometers from the X car, in other words, it can get away one kilometer for each 2 minutes.

Read the distance (in km) and calculate how long it takes (in minutes) for the car Y to take this distance in relation to the other car.

INPUT
The input file contains 1 integer value.

OUTPUT
Print the necessary time followed by the message "minutos" that means minutes in Portuguese.



#include <iostream>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
    
    int X, Y, d;
    
    scanf("%d", &d);
    
    Y = d*2.0;
    
    printf("%d minutos\n", Y);
    
    return 0;
}
